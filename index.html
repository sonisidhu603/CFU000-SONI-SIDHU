            <h1>North-West India</h1>

            <p>Hi, My name is Soni  </p>

            <p1>Here I am going to describe a campaige.</p1>
           <p2>My campaign is a trip around North-West India which is perfect for people who are in
            their early twenties to early 30’s who are working-class to middle class. This tour is fit
            for females who are young and adventurous. The psychographic we’re targeting is
            people who love to learn about different cultures and religions which North-West India
            has a lot of. As well as those who like art, food, nature, shopping, meeting new people
            and seeing tourist attractions. Another critical psychographic target is those wanting to
            travel in a small group of friends and be safe while travelling.</p2>
           
            <p3>We chose a facebook post because it can reach different or specific audiences we
                want. It is a great way to spread our campaign as it is online and anyone can see it. For
                our traditional media, we decided to make posters to be put up at Central station. These
                are effective for those to see who commute to and from the city. Lastly, we made a
                short travel blog to describe to the targeted audience why North-West India is a great
                place to visit.
                Last year I visited North-West India. I went to different places like the Golden Temple
                which is known for beautiful art. Then I visited the Taj Mahal which is a symbol of love
                and a place where we can remember our loved ones. After a few days of travelling, I
                visited Kashmir with my friends which is known it’s beauty of nature. For internal and
                external purity I visited Brahma. From visiting these places, I now know a lot about the
                Hindu religion by meeting different people there.</p3>
                
                <p4>Another place I ventured to is Kullu Manali which has various hill station places, a large
                    ocean and snow. I also saw a Chandigarh which is famous for modernization which I
                    did a lot of shopping at and enjoyed lots of food.
                    My favourite place from all of the above is Golden Temple because when I entered I saw
                    the magnificent beauty of it by standing at the front of the temple. When I sat there and
                    heard the religious music being played I forgot all my worries. I met many people there,
                    ate delicious food and did lots of shopping as well.
                    
                    
                    There are so many historical places with big historical significance such as the Taj
                    Mahal and the Golden Temple. These are great places for people to learn about the
                    religion of the people of India, discover nature and learn more about the culture. A plane
                    
                    ride to the Golden Temple will be included. North-India has lots of amazing
                    gardens/parks, lakes and places for shopping to enjoy. Chandigarh is the perfect place
                    for these as it has a rock garden, rose garden, Sukhna lake, Japanese garden,
                    shopping centre. We will be using a promotional poster for our traditional media to
                    promote North-West India. Our online promotion will be through a Facebook
                    advertisement which will reach our selected audience.</p4>
            
            
            <p5>This campaign will work as it is a well-organised schedule with the places that are
                planned and when they are being gone to. It’s also a very safe campaign for girls
                around their 20’s as the transportation is mainly by bus and the locations are tourist
                attraction locations where it’s filled with people. It’s also a good campaign for someone
                like me as it’s quite a few days long. It’s also a very cultural and adventurous trip which
                allows you to discover various places. You also learn a lot about history as a lot of the
                places are historical and have a lot of background. There’s also a website link provided
                in our advertisement for people to check out our campaign. Full of nature
                One downfall is that there isn’t a proper detailed itinerary which could affect the success
                of this campaign as it’s very eye-catching or convincing. There is also  information
                on prices or accommodation.
